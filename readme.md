readme

This project is the aesthetics training project that was based in Glasgow. 

## There are four main R markdown files: ##

These files are based within an R project called 'glasgow.Rproj'

1. wrangle.Rmd

This file wrangles raw data, produces some summary data plots, saves out data files for modelling and further analysis in later scripts.

2. models.Rmd

This file builds Bayesian regression models.

3. effects_pp.Rmd

This file visualises and tabulates parameters in Analysis 1 (pre vs post), hence
the _pp label.

4. effects_g.Rmd

This file visualises and tabulates parameters in Analysis 2 (generalisation),
hence the _g label.

## There are five folders, which have largely self-explanatory titles: ##

1. /figures/
2. /tables/
3. /models/
4. /data/
5. /fits/
